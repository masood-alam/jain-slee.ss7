		The
		<acronym>ISDN</acronym>
		User Part or ISUP is part of the Signaling System #7 which is used to
		set up telephone calls in Public Switched Telephone Networks. It is
		specified by the ITU-T as part of the Q.76x series.
	</para>
	<para>
		<acronym>ISUP</acronym>
		messages are used to convey call related information between
		<acronym>PSTN</acronym>
		switches.
	</para>
	<para>
		The telephone switches are connected via E1 or T1 trunks which
		transport the speech from the calls. Trunks are divided into 64k/bit
		timeslots. Each time slot is identified with unique
		<literal>Circuit Identification Code</literal>
		(
		<acronym>CIC</acronym>
		). The switches uses this information along with the received signalling
		information (Called Party Number, Calling Part Number...) to determine which
		inbound CICs and outbound CICs should be connected together to provide
		an end to end speech path.
	</para>
	<para>Additionally <acronym>ISUP</acronym> is used to exchange status information about switch capabilities and current resources.</para>
