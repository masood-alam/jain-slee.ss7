		The Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) is defined in ITU-T Recommendations Q.771-Q.775.
		TCAP allows services at network nodes to communicate with each other using an agreed-upon set of data elements.
		The primary purpose of TCAP is to facilitate multiple concurrent dialogs between the same sub-systems on the same machines, 
		using Transaction IDs to differentiate these, similar to the way TCP ports facilitate multiplexing connections between 
		the same IP addresses on the Internet.
